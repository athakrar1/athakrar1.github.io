<h1 align="middle">Assignment 3: PathTracer</h1>
    <h2 align="middle">Nikki Suppala & Anjali Thakrar</h2>

    <div class="padded">
        <p> In this project, we added additional features to our ray tracer from Project 3-1. For the project, we used the staff binaries to give ourselves the basic backbone from project 3-1.
            There were four parts to the project: Mirror and Glass Materials, Microfacet Material,
            Environment Light, and Depth of Field; however, we only had to do two parts. We chose parts 1 and 4.
            In part 1, we implemented mirror and glass models with both reflection and refraction. In part 4,
            we simulated a thin lens to enable the depth of field effect, instead of having everything
            be in focus like in previous projects.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Intersection</h2>
        <p> For our implementation of part 1, we began with the reflect function. For the reflect function, we really just flipped the sign of every value in the vector by multiplying each element by -1. This effectually makes the vector turn 180 degrees, reflecting it.
        </p>

        <p>In the sample_f mirror BDSF function, we set the pdf equal to one and set the outgoing vector to be the reflection of the incoming vector, as a mirror shows a perfect reflection of whatever image is displayed onto it.

            We returned reflectance / abs_cos_theta(*wi) from this function rather than just the reflectance in order to chancel our the cosine expression multiplied by the call to at_least_one_bounce_radiance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we implemented refract(). For this function, we took advantage of Snell’s equations to help us model the visual effects of refraction. First we calculate eta, which is simlpy the ratio of the old index of refraction to the new index of refraction. If the z coordinate of the wo ray is positive, eta = 1.0/ior. However, when it’s negative, eta is ior.
        </p>

        <p> Then, we updated the values of wi using the following equations, which are derived from Snell’s law:
        </p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                        <img src="images/snells.png" width="480px" />
                </tr>
            </table>

        <p> Finally, we return transmittance / abs_cos_theta(*wi) / eta^2. In this expression, we divide by the cosine of wi again to cancel to cosine term in at_least_one_bounce_radiance, and divide by the eta^2 term because the transmittance behaves differently depending on the index of refraction of the material the light ray goes through — it concentrates when it enters a high index of refraction material, while it disperses when it moves out of this high index of refraction material.
        </p>

            <p> Finally, we implemented sample_f for the glass BDSF. For this, we followed the walk through
            in the spec, where we assign the reflection of the output vector to the input, set the pdf value to 1, and returned reflectance / abs_cos_theta(*wi) when there is total internal reflection. If not, we compute Schlick's reflection coefficient R do perform Russian Roulette to determine whether to do a reflection or refraction sequence on the ray.  </p>

        <p>We had a bug for a while where the refracted sphere was somewhat pixelated and had a black square plastered across
        its front side. We then realized that this was because we didn't set the pdf equal to 1 in our sample function! </p>

            <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Depth of Field</h2>
            <div align="middle">
            <p>In previous projects, we used a pin-hole camera model. This is a model in which all the light intersecting a scene
            enters through a single point. This causes the effect of having everything in the scene be equally and fully in focus.
            However, real cameras have finite aperture sizes, so we implemented the thin-lens camera model to create more realistic renders.
            In this model, only objects in the plane focalDistance away from the lens are in focus. The focus worsens
            as you increase or decrease the depth from that plane. The thin-lens model also assumes that the thickness
            of the lens has negligible effect.</p>
            </div>
    <div align="middle">
        <p>
            Previously, our ray tracer shot rays from the origin (0,0,0) toward some direction (X,Y,-1). Now,
            we uniformly sample the lens to get the sampled point on the lens at (S_x, S_y, 0) since we no longer recieve radiance
            from just (0,0,0). The formula to sample is:
        <div align="middle">
        <img src="images/formula.png" width="480px" />
    </div>
            Our generated ray direction from the previous project is ((x - 0.5) * (2 * tan(radians(hFov / 2))), (y - 0.5) * (2 * tan(radians(vFov / 2))), -1).
            This ray times focalDistance is how we calculate pFocus as it intersects the plane of focus with the red segment in the diagram below.
            Then we calculate the ray that originates from pLens, and set its direction towards pFocus (blue segment in the figure), which
            is pFocus - pLens. Finally we normalize the direction of the ray, perform the camera-to-world conversion for both its origin and direction,
            add pos to the ray's origin, and set the near and far clips to be the same as in Project 3-1, Part 1.

            <p>Below is a "focus stack" of a dragon image at 4 visibly different depths through a scene.
            The lens radius is set at 0.3. As the depth increases, we can see how the focused parts of the image
            shift from close to the lens to farther away. The first image has the bottom left corner in focus.
            The second and third images have the front and back of the dragon in focus. The last image has the
            back right corner in focus.</p>

            <p> Our approach to this part of the project was to implement the steps directly from the
            spec and use the image of the rays in the spec to calculate our ray direction and origin. It was pretty
            straightforward from here. The only debugging issue we ran into was that we accidentally normalized
            both the origin and direction of the ray, instead of just the direction of the ray initially. What we learned
            from this part was exactly how aperture size affects focus and how important it is to be
            at a certain distance from the lens for an image to turn out well.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Partner work</h2>
    <p>We worked well as a team and as partners, each doing an equal amount of work. We both
    worked together on both parts of the project and debugged together in project parties and office hours. We also both contributed
    equally to the write-up. From past projects, we improved a lot with time management and worked
    over Spring break to finish early. Overall, it went greatly!</p>
